# PythonPassword-Checker-Generator
The Password Checker &amp; Generator is a Python-based desktop application that allows users to check the strength of their passwords and generate new secure passwords based on user-defined criteria. The application utilizes Tkinter, a standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit, for its graphical user interface (GUI).

### Features:

Password Strength Checker: Users can enter their passwords into the application, and the application will analyze the password's strength based on various factors such as the presence of lowercase and uppercase letters, digits, special characters, and more. The application then displays the password's strength level (Weak, Normal, Good, Strong, Strongest, or Super Strong) and the corresponding score.
Password Generator: Users can generate new passwords by defining the desired length and selecting whether to include lowercase and uppercase letters, digits, special characters, and whitespace. The application will then generate a random password that meets the specified criteria.
Dark Mode: The application supports a toggleable dark mode, allowing users to switch between light and dark themes for improved visibility and comfort.
Hover Tooltips: Tooltips or help text is displayed when users hover over checkboxes or input fields, providing a brief explanation of each option to help users better understand the password generation process.
Copy to Clipboard: The generated passwords can be automatically copied to the user's clipboard, making it easy for users to paste the password into other applications.
